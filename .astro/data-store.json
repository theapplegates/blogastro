Each file becomes a page, and you control layout with frontmatter and layout components.\n```js\nimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';\nimport sitemap from \"@astrojs/sitemap\";\nimport mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';\n// https://astro.build/config\nexport default defineConfig({\n  vite: {\n    plugins: [tailwindcss()],\n  },\n  markdown: {\n    drafts: true,\n    shikiConfig: {\n      theme: \"css-variables\"\n    }\n  },\n  shikiConfig: {\n    wrap: true,\n    skipInline: false,\n    drafts: true\n  },\n  site: 'https://yourdomain.com',\n  integrations: [sitemap(), mdx()]\n});\n```\n\nWhy it’s great for content creators:\n- Clean, readable syntax  \n- Frontmatter controls metadata  \n- Supports components via MDX  \n- Easy to version and manage in Git  \n\n### Styling your story\n\nWith Astro’s component-based architecture, you can apply custom styles, inject interactive blocks, and reuse layouts—all while keeping your content separate from your presentation.\n\nPair it with Tailwind CSS or your own design system for complete control.\n\n### Publish like a pro\n\nOnce you’re ready, deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or your own server. No complicated build tools, no bloated runtimes—just fast, static output ready to go.\n\nWhether you're a solo blogger or building docs for your next startup, Astro gives you everything you need to publish with confidence.\n```html\n\u003Csection>\n  \u003CWrapper variant=\"standard\">\n    \u003Cdiv\n      class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-3 border-b pb-8 pt-24 border-base-200 dark:border-base-800\"\n    >\n      \u003Cdiv>\n        \u003CText\n          tag=\"h1\"\n          variant=\"textSM\"\n          class=\"font-medium text-base-900 dark:text-white\"\n          >Michael Andreuzza\u003C/Text\n        >\n        \u003CText\n          tag=\"p\"\n          variant=\"textXS\"\n          class=\" text-base-600 dark:text-base-400\"\n          >Product Designer in Åland Islands\u003C/Text\n        >\n      \u003C/div>\n      \u003CText\n        tag=\"p\"\n        variant=\"textSM\"\n        class=\"text-base-600 dark:text-base-400 lg:col-span-2\"\n      >\n        I’m a self-taught front-end developer and UI designer with a strong\n        passion for building my own projects.
